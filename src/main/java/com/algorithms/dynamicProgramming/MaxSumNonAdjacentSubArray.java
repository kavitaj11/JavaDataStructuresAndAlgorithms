//Find an efficient algorithm to find the maximum sum of a subsequence in an array
// so that no consecutive elements are part of this subsequence.

//Runtime complexity #
//The runtime complexity of this solution is linear, O(n).

//Memory complexity #
//The memory complexity of this solution is linear, O(n)

//A naive solution to this problem is to calculate the sum of all possible subsequences
// with no adjacent elements and keep track of the subsequence with the maximum sum.
// The time complexity of this approach is O(n^2)
//This can be improved by using dynamic programming.
// Iterate over the entire input array, and in every iteration pick the maximum of these two values:
//Max Sum of the last iteration.
//Max Sum of second last iteration + current iteration index.

//This solution can be improved further by reducing space usage.
// We donâ€™t need to keep an array of previous maximum sums, only storing the last two sums would suffice.
// Also, the algorithm can be modified to track all the indices of this subarray
// with some additional data structures.
